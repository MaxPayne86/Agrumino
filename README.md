# Examples

1. Quickstart: sketches to check basic feature of Agrumino, like reading sensor data, saving data on flash memory and check wifi connection.

2. Cloud: sketches to send sensor data to various cloud backends. All the sketches use deep sleep to save energy and keep a queue of samples in EEPROM (flash).

2. Advanced: sketches that explore the usage of Agrumino with third-parties sensors, actuators, boards such as oled display, water pump and so on.

3. OTA: sketches that send sensor data to the cloud and at the same time demonstrate the usage of Over The Air updates.
